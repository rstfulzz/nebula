// mirrors the write pipeline:
//   1. You      , the operator's intent
//   2. Brain    , the model proposes a plan
//   3. [action] , the cycle's headline beat (policy / simulate / execute)
//   4. Memory   , the decision is recorded locally
//   5. Chain    , the cleared action broadcasts on Mantle (omitted for cycle 3,
//                 where the approval beat IS the finale)
//
// `delayMs` for each station is hand-tuned to fire just after the matching
// left-side moment lands. See TuiCanvas.tsx + TgCanvas.tsx for the left-side
// timing constants. `cycle.durationMs` in lib/cycles.ts is derived as
// `last_station_delayMs + ~3000ms outcome hold`.
